During my time at Notre Dame of Tacurong College, while pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering, our thesis focused on developing a self-driving wheelchair integrated with a vital monitoring system. Specifically, we aimed to monitor the body temperature and pulse rate of the patient.

The self-driving feature of the wheelchair was achieved through the utilization of the Pixy2 camera, which employs machine learning algorithms to detect colored objects. In our design, healthcare personnel wear a red-colored armband, which the Pixy2 camera recognizes as a navigational guide.

However, during our testing phase, we encountered inaccuracies, particularly in the navigation system. To address this limitation, we incorporated IR sensors to detect obstacles, complementing the functionality of the Pixy2 camera.

Despite these challenges, we are proud to report that the overall system functions effectively. We believe our project represents a significant advancement in the realm of assistive technology, providing increased autonomy and safety for wheelchair-bound individuals.
