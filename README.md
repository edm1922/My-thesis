This our thesis during my time in Notre Dame of Tacurong College taking Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering the idea was to build a self-driving wheelchair with a vital monitoring system .
particularly the body temperature and pulse rate of the paitent.
the self-driving of the wheelchair was made possible using the pixy2 camera that uses machine learning by detecting colored objects by making the nurse/healthcare personel wear a red colored armband
as far that we tested it some functionality is not yet accurate mostly in navigation system
we utilized IR sensors to detect objects because the pixy2 camera don't have the function to determine other objects
but overall the system works and we are glad to say that we made it
